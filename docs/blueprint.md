# **App Name**: ResuTrack

## Core Features:

- Entry Form: Form to add new resume details (company name, resume link, registration date, stipend).
- Resume Table: Display a table of all tracked resume entries with columns for company, link, date, and stipend.
- Edit/Delete Functionality: Enable editing and deletion of existing resume entries directly from the table.
- Link Validator: Leverage AI to assess the quality of resume links that have been provided using a 'tool' and provide the user with any tips it might find. Rate the link based on its validity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted teal (#63B3ED) to evoke trust and professionalism, subtly nodding to tech aesthetics.
- Background color: Light gray (#F7FAFC), very slightly tinted with the primary color's hue to keep visual harmony.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#B794F4) to bring a touch of modern vibrancy to interactive elements.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts such as 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for a professional and readable interface.
- Use minimalistic line icons from libraries like 'Font Awesome' or 'Feather Icons' to maintain a clean look.
- Grid-based layout with generous white space to provide a professional user experience and create clarity.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations (e.g., on form submission, row selection) using 'react-spring'.
